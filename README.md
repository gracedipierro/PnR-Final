The final project for my Programming and Robotics class

below are some methods used in my Programming and Robotics final.

explain and reference, aim to self in the future



'menu(self)' - This is a dictionary, that means it is a list with ' custom index values
        # You may change the menu if you'd like


        dance(self)
        turnR(self, deg
        )turnL(self, deg)
        setSpeed(self, left, right)
        # AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
    # central logic loop of my navigation
    def nav(self)
    #This returns true or false
    def isClear(self) -> bool:
    cruise(self):backUp(self):
    # REPLACEMENT TURN METHOD instead of choosePath, find best option to turn
    def kenny(self):

    # this code helps me to calibrate motor speed, told me if it was driving straight
    calibrate(self):
    error():
    quit():
